# Radio 81

A classical command line old tube radio, you can't skip songs... you have to deal with it... Just relax and listen...
like it used to be...

## Additional notes


This is an Beta version I wrote during a mystical crisis, don't blame anyone if that doesn't work in every situation.

I almost forgot... Thanks to Shoutcast and people who are making those beautiful radio stations...
